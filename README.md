# Treasury.

Callisto Network implemented a Treasury model. A certain part of the reward from each block is allocated for the Callisto Team to fund the further development of the project.

A certain portion of this budget can be spent for funding community proposals.

# Proposals

Any member of the community can create a funding proposal. A community member can propose any activity that contributes to the improvement of the Callisto project. The proposal creator can himself implement this proposal and receive a payment for it, or leave the proposal open so that other community members can work on it and receive a reward.

# Submitting a proposal

Follow these steps to submit a proposal:

1. Register a [Github account](http://github.com/).

2. Go to [Callisto Proposals/issues](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Proposals/issues).

3. Click a [New Issue](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Proposals/issues/new) button.

4. Describe your proposal: proposal overview, detailed desctiption and funding goal.

Thats it. Then the proposal will be reviewed. After that, it will be `accepted`, `declined` or discussed further. Once a proposal received an `accepted` status, this means that proposal creator or community members can start working on the proposal. As the requirements for the implementation of the proposal will be met, those who fulfilled them will receive the payment specified in the proposal.

The payment will be sent from [Callisto Treasury](https://cloexplorer.org/addr/0x74682fc32007af0b6118f259cbe7bccc21641600) and described at the [Open Callisto financial report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12b5JgL1veCAvV1yLhmxDva80Gz3pA0OVSPw_uTf9aEQ/edit#gid=1393329941).

All proposals, proposal discussions, financial operations and decisions made by Callisto Team are transparently available to all community members and any discussions are always welcome.

# Financial transparency

Callisto team adheres to the policy of [financial transparency](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/Roadmap/issues/48).

We keep a complete financial history in an open document so that everyone can review it. Financial operations will be described at the above document. Financial operations are verifiable by transaction hashes.

Each financial operation of [Callisto Treasury](https://cloexplorer.org/addr/0x74682fc32007af0b6118f259cbe7bccc21641600) will be documented until an autonomous governance system is created (Planned HardFork №2).

Each financial operation of [Staking Reserve address](https://cloexplorer.org/addr/0x3c06f218ce6dd8e2c535a8925a2edf81674984d9) will be documented until Cold Staking is implemented (Planned HardFork №1).
